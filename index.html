        </h2>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">To know a language means to possess a system of knowledge called <strong>grammar</strong>.
          Grammar is a finite system represented in the mind/brain. As Chomsky demonstrated in the 1950s, it is a mental
          generative procedure using finite means to generate an indefinite number of sentences.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">The term <strong>grammar</strong>, in this context, refers to a psychological entity rather
          than an inventory of sounds, morphemes, inflectional paradigms, and syntactic constructions. Terms like
          <em>passive</em>, <em>relative clause</em>, and <em>interrogative</em> are used for convenience and do not
          have independent status.

        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">How do we acquire the ability to determine if a sentence is ill-formed, comprehend its
          meaning, or recognize ambiguity? Several hypotheses have been proposed, including imitation (section 1.5.1),
          reinforcement (section 1.5.2), association procedures (section 1.5.3), and Universal Grammar (section 1.5.4).

          through Imitation</h3>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">One hypothesis suggests that children learn language by imitating adults. However, evidence
          contradicts this idea:</p>
        <ul class="list-decimal">
          <li class="list-disc">
            <p class="mb-2 mt-1"><strong>Parental Influence:</strong> Studies show that children are not heavily
              influenced by caregivers' speech styles. Parents' utterances, predominantly questions and commands, do not
              align with the simple declaratives that children primarily produce.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-disc">
            <p class="mb-2 mt-1"><strong>Novel Utterances:</strong> Children produce novel utterances, demonstrating
              their ability to generate sentences <strong>they have never heard before</strong>. For instance, English
              learners over-regularize irregular past tense verbs, using forms like "goed" and "singed" that they
              haven't encountered in adult speech.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-disc">
            <p class="mb-2 mt-1"><strong>Unheard Sentence Structures:</strong> Children construct sentences that they
              cannot have heard from adults, indicating a drive to discover linguistic rules. Examples include negative
              questions (Example: (15)) and long-distance extraction questions (Example: (16)).</p>

        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">These instances suggest that imitation does not play a crucial role in language

          Language Learning through Reinforcement</h2>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1"><strong>Behaviorist</strong> psychologists propose that language is learned through the
          <strong>reinforcement</strong> mechanism, involving the contingent association between stimulus and response.
          This general-purpose mechanism is often used to explain various learning processes in animals and humans, as
          outlined by Skinner (1957). According to this view, children learn language by being positively reinforced for
          correct verbal expressions and negatively reinforced for errors.

          Reinforcement Hypothesis</h3>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">However, this hypothesis faces several challenges:</p>

        <ul class="list-decimal">
          <li class="list-disc">Children acquire competence over an indefinite number of sentences, understanding and

        <ul class="list-decimal">
          <li class="list-disc">
            <p class="mb-2 mt-1">Parents generally pay attention to the content of what children say rather than its
              grammatical correctness. Responses to children's questions (Example: (17) and (18)) demonstrate that
              reinforcement is vague. While responding, the mother reinforces the child's communication by acknowledging
              understanding, but this does not necessarily indicate grammatical correctness.</p>

          <li class="list-disc">Even when parents correct children's ungrammatical sentences, corrections often go

        <blockquote class="italic text-neutral-500 font-medium">
          <p class="mb-2 mt-1">In summary, the reinforcement hypothesis falls short in explaining the complexity of
            language acquisition and the nuanced nature of linguistic competence. Other factors, such as the ability to
            understand and produce novel sentences, suggest that reinforcement mechanisms alone are insufficient.</p>

        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">If infants are endowed with the capacity to learn any language, they should show this

        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">The fact that infants discriminate their <strong>native language</strong> from a

          babies exposed to British English do not discriminate English from Dutch, a fact we will come back to.)

        <p class="mb-2 mt-1"><strong> TODO ADD FIGURE </strong>
          A typical experimental setting for the <strong>high-amplitude sucking procedure (HAS)</strong>. Newborns are
          placed in a crib in a semireclining position and suck a pacifier linked to a pressure transducer connected to
          a computer that controls the delivery of stimuli from a loudspeaker. (Picture kindly made available by Jacques
          Mehler.)</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">But how can researchers establish that young babies discriminate languages? The standard
          technique is a habituation-recovery procedure that exploits infants' <strong>sucking behavior</strong>: the
          <strong>high-amplitude sucking procedure (HAS)</strong> (see also Jusczyk 1997 for a description of this
          technique).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">In a typical experiment using the HAS, infants suck on a pacifier, which is linked to a
          pressure transducer connected to a computer, enabling their <strong>sucking rate</strong> to be measured.
          Stimuli are presented through a loudspeaker. The more vigorously infants suck, the more stimuli they receive.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">A typical setting is presented in <strong>Figure 2.1</strong>. An experiment using the HAS
          procedure starts by measuring infants' <strong>sucking rate</strong> in the absence of any stimulation, to
          determine each infant's <strong>baseline</strong>. Then the habituation phase starts. During this phase
          linguistic stimuli are presented, in general contingent on infants' <strong>sucking rate</strong>. This aspect
          of the experiment exploits the fact that infants are very good at learning the connection between
          <strong>sucking and sounds</strong> and then using sucking to trigger stimulation. When infants have heard the
          same stimulus for a while, they become habituated to it and suck less.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">When the infant's <strong>sucking rate</strong> has reached a predetermined habituation
          criterion (a one-third decrement in <strong>sucking rate</strong>), the experimental phase starts. Infants are
          assigned to one of two conditions. In the experimental condition, infants are presented with new stimuli,
          while in the control condition, infants continue to receive the same stimuli they have heard in the
          habituation phase.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">To demonstrate that infants discriminate between two sets of stimuli, one must compare the
          <strong>sucking responses</strong> of the experimental group with the <strong>sucking responses</strong> of
          the control group before and after the change. If infants in the experimental group are sufficiently
          interested by the new stimuli, they should suck more than infants in the control group. Since the only
          difference between the two groups before and after the change is the occurrence or nonoccurrence of new
          stimuli, a different response (increased <strong>sucking</strong> or lack thereof) by the two groups is
          interpreted as discrimination between the two sets of stimuli.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">This technique can be used with infants up to 3 months of age.1 For concreteness, let us
          consider the experiment carried out by Mehler et al. (1988). In the habituation phase, infant French learners
          from both the experimental and the control groups heard Russian utterances. When they were habituated—that is,
          when their <strong>sucking rate</strong> declined to a predetermined criterion—the experimental phase started.
          During this phase, the control group continued to hear Russian utterances, and the experimental group started
          to hear French utterances. While the habituation phase was identical for the two groups of babies, the
          experimental phase differed. Therefore, a difference in the <strong>sucking responses</strong> of the
          experimental and control groups must be attributed to the single change that occurred during the experimental
          phase, that is, the delivery of new stimuli to the experimental group.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1"><strong> TODO ADD FIGURE </strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1"><strong>Figure 2.2</strong> displays the <strong>sucking responses</strong> of infant
          French learners to Russian and French. As the figure indicates, during the habituation phase, the
          <strong>sucking rate</strong> increased and then decreased for both the control group and the experimental
          group. During the experimental phase, infants in the experimental group <strong>sucked more</strong> than
          infants in the control group. From this difference, we infer that the experimental group detected the change.

          2.1.2 Discrimination between Two Foreign Languages</h2>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">From the previous discussion, it is apparent that babies can discriminate their native
          language from a foreign language soon after birth. It is possible that language-specific influences have
          already left a trace after a few days of exposure or even that infants have already become familiar with
          certain properties of their linguistic environment before birth.2 However, neither possibility explains
          newborns' ability to distinguish between foreign languages, that is, languages they have not been exposed to.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">Four-day-old infants born into a French-speaking environment distinguish between English
          and Italian utterances (see Mehler et al. 1988, reanalyzed in Mehler and Christophe 1995) and between English
          and Japanese utterances (see Nazzi, Bertoncini, and Mehler 1998; and see Cristophe and Morton 1998 for
          evidence that this also occurs at 2 months). <strong>Table 2.2</strong> summarizes the major results from
          studies of foreign language discrimination by babies, some of which we will examine later.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">The early capacity to distinguish the native language from a foreign one and even one
          foreign language from another is very intriguing. Since infants can discriminate between two foreign languages
          they have never heard before participating in the experiment, it must be the case that during the experiment
          they can rapidly build some sort of representation.</p>

        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">All these facts suggest that there exist certain salient acoustic properties that capture
          infants' interest and that can be extracted from utterances in very little time and with limited exposure.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">Beyond showing that babies can discriminate between foreign languages, <strong>Table
            2.2</strong> shows that in some cases they fail to do so. For example, 2-month-old American English learners
          are unable to discriminate French from Russian, something that 4-day-olds born into a French-speaking
          environment can do (see <strong>Table 2.1</strong>). Similarly, 2-month-old British English learners cannot
          discriminate French from Japanese (see Christophe and Morton 1998) (we will look later at other findings
          reported in <strong>Table 2.2</strong>).</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">One reason for this failure to discriminate may be that some developmental change occurs
          within the first months of life. As the table shows, newborns can discriminate between any two foreign
          languages (babies born into a French-speaking environment can discriminate English from Japanese and English
          from Italian), while at 2 months their ability is more constrained (babies born into an English-speaking
          environment can discriminate Dutch from Japanese, but not French from Russian or French from Japanese). It is
          not clear why there are such differences in discriminating between pairs of languages (see <strong>section
            2.1.4.2</strong>).</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">Moreover, there is one pair of languages that even newborns cannot discriminate: 4-day-olds
          born into a French-speaking environment cannot discriminate English from Dutch (see Nazzi, Bertoncini, and
          Mehler 1998). We will return to this fact in <strong>section 2.1.4.1</strong>.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">A word of caution is needed, however. One might object to a developmental explanation since
          the pairs of languages used and the native languages of the babies tested vary across studies. Although we
          know that at 2 months infant English learners cannot discriminate French from Russian and French from
          Japanese, we do not know what they would have done at 4 days with the same pairs of languages. Moreover, we
          know that at 4 and 5 days infants born into a French-speaking environment can discriminate English from
          Italian and English from Japanese, respectively, but we do not know what they would do at 2 months. To be
          certain that the change in performance between younger and older babies is due to developmental factors,
          additional experimentation is needed.</p>

          Discrimination</h2>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">We have seen that very young infants can <strong>discriminate</strong> between pairs of
          languages, even though they are not familiar with them; they do so on the basis of very little information.
          <strong>Dehaene-Lambertz</strong> and <strong>Houston (1998)</strong> showed that infants can
          <strong>recognize</strong> their <strong>native language</strong> after hearing <strong>1200 ms</strong> of an
          utterance, or roughly half a dozen syllables (see also <strong>Bosch</strong> and <strong>Sebastia n-Galle s
            (1997)</strong>).

        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">But how did the infants in these studies manage to <strong>discriminate</strong> between
          pairs of languages? It is very implausible that they could have <strong>recognized</strong> some words of the
          languages, because at <strong>4 days</strong>, the age at which infants were tested, they are unlikely to have
          any lexical knowledge.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">One possibility is that the babies responded to some <strong>coarse acoustic
            characteristics</strong> of the samples, such as <strong>the mean energy of the utterances</strong> or
          <strong>the pitch</strong>. To test this hypothesis, <strong>Mehler et al. (1988)</strong> presented the same
          <strong>French</strong> and <strong>Russian</strong> stimuli used in the experiment discussed in section
          <strong>2.1.1</strong>, but played <strong>backward</strong>. In this way, the prosody of the utterance is
          modified, but the energy of the signal is the same. If babies exploit some gross acoustic property of speech,
          they should <strong>discriminate</strong> between languages even when the stimuli are played backward. This
          prediction did not stand up: under these conditions <strong>4-day-old babies</strong> born into a
          <strong>French-speaking environment</strong> were unable to <strong>discriminate French from Russian</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">Another possibility is that infants accomplish the <strong>discrimination</strong> task by
          <strong>recognizing</strong> <strong>segmental properties</strong>, like place of articulation or manner of
          articulation, of the languages. Indeed, in some of the experiments mentioned in sections
          <strong>2.1.1</strong> and <strong>2.1.2</strong> real-language samples were used.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">To figure out whether infants draw upon <strong>segmental information</strong> to
          accomplish the language <strong>discrimination</strong> task, <strong>Mehler et al. (1988)</strong> and other
          researchers have tested infants with <strong>low-pass-filtered speech</strong>, that is, speech in which only
          frequencies below <strong>400 Hz</strong> were retained. This transformation reduces <strong>segmental
            content</strong> (single sounds can no longer be identified) and preserves <strong>prosodic or
            suprasegmental information</strong> (intonation, rhythm).3 If infants were relying on <strong>segmental
            information</strong>, they should not have been able to <strong>discriminate between low-pass-filtered
            samples from different languages</strong> because, in these samples, the <strong>segmental
            information</strong> was gone. The finding that infants nonetheless succeeded under these conditions
          indicates that infants do not rely on <strong>segmental information</strong> to <strong>discriminate between
            languages</strong> but on some <strong>prosodic properties</strong> of speech.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1"><strong>Prosodic information</strong> is thus <strong>sufficient</strong> for telling
          languages apart. Is it also <strong>necessary</strong>? In <strong>low-pass-filtered speech</strong>, some
          rudimentary <strong>segmental information</strong> is indeed retained, and this may be enough for infants to
          <strong>discriminate between languages</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">To discard this explanation, <strong>Dehaene-Lambertz and Houston (1998)</strong> presented
          infants with <strong>multisyllabic words</strong> extracted from sentences and reassembled in a
          <strong>scrambled order</strong>. The aim of this manipulation was to destroy the <strong>suprasegmental
            coherence</strong> of the utterance and to preserve <strong>phonemic information</strong> and information
          about the <strong>prosody of single words</strong>. If <strong>phonemic information</strong> or
          <strong>word-level prosody</strong> is enough to <strong>discriminate between two languages</strong>, babies
          listening to words reassembled in a <strong>scrambled order</strong> should have no trouble
          <strong>discriminating between languages</strong>. By contrast, if <strong>phonemic information</strong> or
          <strong>word-level prosody</strong> is not <strong>sufficient</strong>, babies listening to scrambled words
          should not be able to <strong>discriminate between languages</strong>. Indeed, <strong>2-month-old American
            English learners</strong> failed to <strong>discriminate between English and French</strong> in the
          <strong>scrambled-order condition</strong>, but they succeeded when the <strong>prosodic information</strong>
          of the utterances was preserved as with <strong>low-pass-filtered stimuli</strong>. Thus, the <strong>prosodic
            information</strong> contained in brief (<strong>1200 ms</strong>) utterances is both <strong>sufficient and
            necessary</strong> for telling languages apart.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">(Note that what matters is <strong>prosodic information</strong> at the level of the
          utterance and not at the level of single words. In fact, in the <strong>scrambled-order condition</strong>,
          the <strong>prosodic structure</strong> of words was available but did not elicit a <strong>discrimination
            response</strong>.)</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">We have seen that infants rely on some <strong>prosodic information</strong> to
          <strong>discriminate</strong> between languages. Can we be more precise about the nature of the information
          they rely upon? <strong>Discrimination</strong> requires infants to build a representation of the first set of
          stimuli (utterances from one language), then compare it with a second set of stimuli (utterances from a new
          language), and determine whether these new stimuli match the earlier representation. This leads to a new
          question: what is the nature of the representation that infants rely on during a language
          <strong>discrimination</strong> task?
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1"><strong>Mehler et al. (1996)</strong> propose that infants extract and build a
          representation of languages based on <strong>rhythmic properties</strong>, which are known to vary across
          languages. Dutch and English sound very different from Spanish and Italian, a difference that <strong>Lloyd
            James (1940)</strong> described by saying that the first two languages have a "Morse code rhythm'' and the
          second two a "machine gun rhythm.'' Building on this intuition, linguists have coarsely classified languages
          into <strong>stress-timed</strong>, <strong>syllable-timed</strong>, and <strong>mora-timed</strong>
          languages.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">(1)</p>
        <ol start="1">
          <li class="list-disc"><strong>Stress-timed languages</strong>: Dutch, English, Russian, Swedish</li>
          <li class="list-disc"><strong>Syllable-timed languages</strong>: Italian, French, Greek, Spanish</li>
          <li class="list-disc"><strong>Mora-timed languages</strong>: Japanese, Tamil</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">What distinguishes these classes of languages is the subjective perception of their
          <strong>temporal organization</strong>. In <strong>stress-timed languages</strong> listeners perceive a
          regular recurrence of stress, in <strong>syllable-timed languages</strong> a regular recurrence of syllables,
          and in <strong>mora-timed languages</strong> a regular recurrence of morae. It is now believed that this
          distinction in classes of languages is not a primitive property, but the result of interactions between
          phonological properties of languagesÐfor example, syllable structure and vowel reduction. Stress-timed
          languages have a greater variety of syllable types than syllable-timed languages; in these languages heavy
          syllables tend to be stressed and light ones to be stressless.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">On the basis of investigating eight languages (Catalan, Dutch, English, French, Italian,
          Japanese, Polish, Spanish), <strong>Ramus, Nespor, and Mehler (1999)</strong> and <strong>Ramus and Mehler
            (1999)</strong> have shown that the distinction among the three rhythmic classes in (1) re¯ects phonetic
          properties of the speech signal, thus supporting the validity of the notion of rhythmic class.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">As noted, <strong>Mehler et al. (1996)</strong> propose that infants
          <strong>discriminate</strong> between languages on the basis of a <strong>rhythmic representation</strong>
          (the <strong>rhythm-based language discrimination hypothesis</strong>) (see also <strong>Nazzi, Bertoncini,
            and Mehler (1998)</strong>). The rhythmic representation is a coarse representation in terms of "a
          succession of vowels of variable duration and intensities, alternating with periods of unanalyzed noise''
          (standing for consonants) (<strong>Ramus, Nespor, and Mehler 1999</strong>, 270). This hypothesis grants a
          central role to vowels. In fact, vowels are acoustically very salient: they carry most of the energy of the
          speech signal, are louder than consonants, and attract infants' attention more than consonants do.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">Infants' representation of utterances as a sequence of vowels varies depending on the
          <strong>rhythmic properties</strong> of the language, that is, whether it is stress-timed, syllable-timed, or
          mora-timed. (2) is an approximate depiction of infants' rhythmic representations, where V stands for a heavy
          vowel and v for a light one.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">(2)</p>
        <ol start="1">
          <li class="list-disc">V Vv VVvV <strong>stress-timed</strong> (e.g., English)</li>
          <li class="list-disc">V VV V VV V <strong>syllable-timed</strong> (e.g., Spanish)</li>
          <li class="list-disc">VVVVVVVVV <strong>mora-timed</strong> (e.g., Japanese)</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">In <strong>stress-timed languages</strong>, (2a), the interval between vowels is long and
          irregular, because of these languages' greater variability of syllable structure. In stress-timed languages
          there is great variability in the number of consonants per syllable; for example, English and Dutch have 16
          and 19 syllable types and a maximum of seven segments per syllable (see <strong>Nespor 1990</strong>).
          Finally, in these languages there is great variability in the duration of syllables.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">In <strong>syllable-timed languages</strong>, (2b), the distance between vowels is shorter
          and more regular since there are few types of syllables. For example, Spanish has 9 syllable types that
          contain at most five segments (see <strong>Nespor 1990</strong>); Italian and Greek have 8 syllable types.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">In <strong>mora-timed languages</strong>, (2c), the distance between vowels is even shorter
          than in syllable-timed languages and even more regular, for these languages have long vowels, which correspond
          to two regular vowels.</p>

          class="text-xl first:mt-0 mt-2.5 font-bold mb-2.5">2.1.4.1 Evidence for the Rhythm-Based Language
          Discrimination Hypothesis</h2>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">According to the hypothesis that infants build a representation of languages in terms of
          rhythm and that they use rhythmic information to <strong>discriminate</strong> between pairs of languages,
          infants classify languages on the basis of their global rhythmic properties and disregard the specific
          identity of a language; that is, they classify languages within rhythmic classes. This hypothesis predicts
          that infants can <strong>discriminate</strong> between languages with different metrical patterns, but not
          between languages with the same metrical patternÐfor example, two stress-timed languages such as Dutch and
          English.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">The predictions (P) are summarized in (3).</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">As shown in section <strong>2.1.1</strong>, <strong>newborns</strong> can
          <strong>discriminate</strong> their native language from a wide variety of languages. Looking back at
          <strong>table 2.1</strong> through the lens of the <strong>rhythm-based language discrimination
            hypothesis</strong>, we realize that three of the predictions in (3) are fulfilled.

        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">So far no experiment has tested infants' ability to <strong>discriminate</strong> a
          <strong>syllable-timed</strong> from a <strong>mora-timed language</strong> with babies exposed to either a
          <strong>syllable-timed</strong> or a <strong>mora-timed language</strong>. Therefore, we have no evidence
          bearing on prediction P3.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">The findings summarized in (4) provide ample evidence that infants
          <strong>discriminate</strong> between languages from different rhythmic classes. Interestingly,
          <strong>newborns</strong> living in a <strong>French-speaking environment</strong> cannot
          <strong>discriminate</strong> between two foreign languages from the same rhythmic class: Dutch and English
          (see <strong>Nazzi, Bertoncini, and Mehler 1998</strong>; see <strong>table 2.2</strong>). The same finding is
          replicated with <strong>2-month-old British English learners</strong> (see <strong>Christophe and Morton
            1998</strong>; see <strong>table 2.1</strong>). These results support the hypothesis that the rhythmic
          information infants rely upon is class-specific and not language-specific. Eventually, at 5 months, babies
          learning English are able to <strong>discriminate</strong> Dutch from English, likely because they have become
          more familiar with their native tongue or have access to a more detailed representation of their language (see
          <strong>Nazzi, Jusczyk, and Johnson 2000</strong>; see <strong>table 2.1</strong>). The same explanation can
          be extended to account for why 4-month-old Catalan and Spanish learners can <strong>discriminate</strong>
          between Spanish and Catalan, two syllable-timed languages. It would be interesting to know how these babies
          would have responded at 4 days.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">The most convincing confirmation of the <strong>rhythm-based language discrimination
            hypothesis</strong> comes from an experiment carried out by <strong>Nazzi, Bertoncini, and Mehler
            (1998)</strong>. In this experiment filtered utterances were drawn from four languages: two
          <strong>syllable-timed languages</strong> (Italian and Spanish) and two <strong>stress-timed
            languages</strong> (Dutch and English). No language was familiar to the babies tested, who were from a
          <strong>French-speaking environment</strong>. <strong>Four-day-old infants</strong> were assigned to one of
          two groups. The <strong>rhythmic group</strong> was habituated to a combination of filtered sentences from two
          languages of the same rhythmic class (Italian/Spanish or Dutch/English); the <strong>nonrhythmic
            group</strong> was habituated to a combination of filtered sentences from two languages belonging to
          different rhythmic classes (English/Italian or Dutch/Spanish). During the experimental phase, the infants in
          the rhythmic group experienced a class change: they listened to filtered sentences from two languages
          belonging to the other rhythmic class (if they first heard Italian/Spanish, they then heard Dutch/English, and
          vice versa). The infants in the nonrhythmic group also listened to new stimuli, but these were drawn from the
          same two rhythmic classes used in the habituation phase (if these infants first heard English/Italian, they
          then heard Dutch/Spanish, and vice versa). The design is summarized in <strong>table 2.4</strong>. The main
          finding of the experiment is that after the change the rhythmic group started to suck significantly more than
          the nonrhythmic group. Therefore, it must be inferred that only the rhythmic group detected a change in
          stimuli, that is, a change from one rhythmic class to the other. As the stimuli presented to the nonrhythmic
          group also changedÐthe individual languages were not the same in the habituation and experimental phases it
          must be deduced that this change did not result in a <strong>discrimination response</strong>. The conclusion
          must be that infants <strong>discriminate</strong> between classes of languages and not individual languages.

          Language Discrimination and Development</h2>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">We have seen that although <strong>4- or 5-day-old infants</strong> can
          <strong>discriminate</strong> between some pairs of foreign languages, at <strong>2 months</strong> they
          cannot. For example, <strong>2-month-old American English and British English learners</strong> cannot
          <strong>discriminate</strong> French from Russian or French from Japanese, respectively (<strong>Mehler et al.
            1988</strong>; <strong>Christophe and Morton 1998</strong>; see <strong>table 2.2</strong>). Interestingly,
          however, <strong>2-month-old babies learning English</strong> can <strong>discriminate</strong> Dutch from
          Japanese. How can this be? Why are some pairs of foreign languages still <strong>discriminated</strong> at

        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">The <strong>rhythm-based language discrimination hypothesis</strong> proposes that infants
          perceive and represent speech using <strong>syllable-like units</strong>, particularly the
          <strong>vowel</strong>. This suggests that the <strong>syllable</strong> or the <strong>vocalic
            nucleus</strong> serves as a universal unit for infants in organizing speech.
        </p>
        <h3 id="evidence-supporting-the-hypothesis" class="text-lg mt-2 font-semibold mb-2">Evidence Supporting the
          Hypothesis</h3>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">Three studies provide support for this hypothesis. First, <strong>4-day-olds</strong> in a
          <strong>French-speaking environment</strong> can distinguish between changes from <strong>bisyllabic to
            trisyllabic items</strong> but not changes in the number of <strong>phonemes</strong> with the same syllable
          count. Second, these infants can <strong>discriminate</strong> between bi- and trisyllabic Japanese items but
          not between bisyllabic items with varying <strong>morae</strong>. In a different experiment, newborns were
          exposed to syllables sharing the same <strong>vowel</strong> or <strong>consonant</strong>, and they detected
          changes when the vowel changed but not when the consonant changed.

        <h3 id="universal-role-of-vowels-in-representation" class="text-lg mt-2 font-semibold mb-2">Universal Role of
          Vowels in Representation</h3>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">These results support the idea that infants build a representation based on

          could discern changes from <strong>bisyllabic to trisyllabic items</strong> and discriminate between bi- and

        </h2>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">Infants exhibit a remarkably specialized ability to process speech input. By <strong>4 days
            old</strong>, they can <strong>discriminate their native language from a foreign one</strong> and even
          <strong>distinguish between two foreign languages</strong>. This discrimination ability is grounded in the
          <strong>rhythmic properties</strong> of speech.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">In the early stages, newborns construct a basic and underspecified <strong>rhythmic
            representation</strong> of speech, focusing on <strong>syllables or vowels</strong>—distinct and salient
          units that capture their attention. This initial representation is sufficiently robust for an initial
          classification of languages into rhythmic classes.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">This rudimentary rhythmic representation lays the foundation for developing a more nuanced
          and detailed representation that aligns closely with the <strong>phonological properties</strong> of their
          native language. The process involves a progression from a broad rhythmic classification to a more refined
          understanding of the intricacies of the native language's phonology.</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="mb-2 mt-1">Infants differentiate languages not just by rhythm but also by the <strong>sounds</strong>
          used in words. Languages vary in the <strong>20 to 60 phonemes</strong> they employ. For instance, English has
          about 40 phonemes, while Italian has 33. Some languages, like Japanese, merge sounds like /l/ and /r/.</p>
